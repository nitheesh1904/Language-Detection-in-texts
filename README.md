# Language Detection from Text 
# Language Detection

# Overview
Language Detection from Text is a project that aims to predict the language of a given text input. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically identify the language in which the text is written. This can be useful for various applications such as language-specific text processing, content filtering, and multilingual support in software applications. When Coming across a new language would be very essential to identify which language the text is,so that we furthur translation can be done.

# How it Works
The language detection model is trained on a dataset containing text samples from multiple languages. The model uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to learn patterns and features specific to each language. Once trained, the model can take a new text input as an input and predict the language to which it most likely belongs.

# Setup
To run the Language Detection from Text project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the Gradio UI Application: To use the pre-trained model for language detection, run the Gradio UI application.
